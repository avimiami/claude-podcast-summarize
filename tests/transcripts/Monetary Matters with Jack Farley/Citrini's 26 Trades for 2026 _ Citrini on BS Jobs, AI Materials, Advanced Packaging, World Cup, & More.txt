More and more, returns are being driven by the themes a company is exposed to. That's why thematic equity research is so valuable. Today, I'm speaking with a clear leader in thematic research, Citrini. Many of you are familiar with Citrini's work, but in addition to research, the Citrini team also has a tool called the Citrindex to track custom indexes and baskets that they build. This helps investors track performance, think through trade expression, and improve portfolio construction.  Throughout this interview, we're going to put up some charts from the Citrindex so we can show you various baskets that we're talking about. The Citrindex subscription is a separate product from Citrini Research. And up until recently, if you wanted to subscribe to both, you needed to buy them separately. But now you can get Citrini Research and the Citrindex together in one bundle through Substack. Check out my link in the description or go to citrineresearch.com slash mmjack for an exclusive 25% discount on this bundle. The deal expires on January 14th. Let's get into it.  joined once again by an investor and analyst who i respect a lot i really like the way he thinks about markets and i know many in my audience do as well citrini welcome back to monetary matters how are you thinking about  markets in 2026. For subscribers, you recently wrote 26 trades for 2026. So you have an incredibly large and voluminous number of trade ideas. But where are you thinking you're going to be seeing the opportunity in 2026? And what is the difference between something that's just on the bookshelf versus something that is actually going to be implemented in your model portfolio for clients as well as you personally? Thanks for having me back, Jack.  every year that i do this it surprises me by the middle of the year which trades i end up putting on which i don't normally what happens is i have a couple that i'm really like this is gonna this is definitely gonna make it into the portfolio and then i get halfway through the year and i look at what actually makes it into the portfolio and it's not that uh last year we had a piece uh i think it was like the 16th trade that was like if you remember you remember when there were all those drones over new jersey  And we just kind of memory hold it. So that was happening around the time we were writing 25 trades. And I looked at that and I said, people are going to start thinking about like counter unmanned aerial surveillance, how to defend against electronic warfare and this stuff. And then around the Iran escalation, put on the quote unquote drone basket, but it had nothing to do with the drones in New Jersey. So it's always interesting to see how the year progresses.  There are a few that I have pretty high conviction on so far. But again, it's mostly a thematic watch list. The reason I like doing it is just because it forces you to look at things that you otherwise wouldn't really think about. And so when we did that interview last year, 25 Trades for 2025, we talked a lot about themes. We talked about electronic warfare or drones. We talked about Ukraine, Russia normalization. And those themes were up 76% and 75% year to date. And you actually reviewed all of the themes.  A little more than half of them outperformed the S&P and more than 80% had positive returns. So definitely helped by the fact that we had a bull market, but very solid performance there. And I should say also point out that there were some dumb ones in there too, right? Like just for anyone that reads this and is like, yeah, I'm going to put on every single one of these traits. Like the one of them was we looked at like these were mittens companies and they were so cheap and so enticing. I don't even remember what we said, but I looked back at it when we went to do the scorecard and I was like.  Why did we think that remittances would do well when Trump's doing like mass deportations? That doesn't make any sense. So again, it's something where really the purpose of this is in our vocation, we spend so much time thinking about being right about the future. And you...  I inevitably will run into a point where you look at like, this happened for me with gold miners this year, where it was like, I remember looking at gold miners and they're so cheap relative to where gold's at. And I just didn't do anything with it. And it was because I got so in the weeds on it. And I was like, ah, you know, like mine's just a pole with a wire standing on top of it. And I ended up deciding against it. And I look back and I say, man, if I had just.  done the obvious thing, which is buy the gold miners, because gold's already up 40% of your day, that would have been a great trade. You always find yourself missing some obvious things. And that's inevitable. But for me, at least the way that you can most effectively defend against that is once in a while, you just allow yourself the time to not feel the pressure of everything I do needs to be right, I need to be skating towards and you just say, what do I think is going to happen? What like, what are the kind of obvious whether not so obvious? What's the  biggest list I can make of things that probably could happen. And that's what this is. It's like the one time a year where we're not just neurotic about being right. Right. And you also have a model portfolio, the Citrindex that you track very rigorously and that the Citrindex I see for 2025 as we record is up.  22% year to date versus 18.5% for the S&P 500. And since inception in 2023, the Citrin index is up 217% versus 69% for the S&P. And that is a way to actually track what's doing. Because I could have my investment newsletter and I throw out a thousand ideas and 10 of them are going to make me look like an absolute genius, but actually determining...  The sizing, the entry points, the exit points, rotations, when to hold on to a winner. Like that is really what makes a great investor, not just the idea. So I think that's important. And Monetary Matters listeners can get.  that we're you're selling that as a bundle so the citrini research substack as well as the citrindex a tracking tool where you can track all of the baskets and that in real time for that bundle monetary matters listeners can get a 25 discount until the middle of january and i i think james there there are some hedge funds that are not tracking like  with as much rigor their positions as this is trend deck. So even though it is a model portfolio, I've been using it and I'm definitely impressed by it. Tell us a little bit about that. Well, like you said, you know, when you're writing research, the easiest thing is, you know, you write the research.  the things that are wrong you never really talk about them again you know you say like so and so stock is along and then it goes up and you say yeah look look how sick we did it it's very rare i think and it's like the much more difficult thing to do obviously if you're managing a portfolio eventually you take a drawdown or you underperform that happens right and when anyone can log into a website and see it it's you know thank you oh  You're talking about this, but you took a drive on it. Yeah, well, that happens. But it's, for me, the most effective way to communicate whether I still think that something's a good opportunity, whether we can always write about something, and then it's a different matter entirely of, is this just interesting? Is this something that you're actively buying? Is this something that, what's your timeframe on this? It's just, we're all...  reading research because we want to make money in the stock market so it's not for me at least it's the most effective way of communicating that and the other cool thing that that i have focused on with citrini is creating these kinds of thematic factors if you think about um artificial intelligence for example it's not necessarily the same as growth or tech and there will be periods of time where things find themselves into you know quote-unquote ai factor that  wouldn't necessarily otherwise be included. Obviously, you're going to have all the data center stuff in there in terms of semiconductors. But what about when power becomes, you know, something that everyone's talking about and, you know, Jeep or Nova and Siemens Energy find their way into that factor and start trading with beta to this AI factor. So it has every single basket that we've ever created and you can and real time tracking and you can get a good feel on at least for our thematic universe, which now after three years is pretty.  deep like we have a deep bench of themes it's like a it's a very interesting addition to just like tracking your classic lowball growth dividend whatever factors seeing now 132 baskets that that is a lot of asking so james so talk about the ai trade broadening i'm reading from your 26 trades piece  You write that the surefire path to being early to some of the most profitable parts of the AI trade has been looking at areas that currently have little to no AI premium baked in and reasoning out six to 12 months as to whether they'll become a crucial part of the supply chain. So basically buying stocks that no one really associates with AI, but make products or services that are related to AI that are going to be in high demand as the AI build out continues.  So the topic that's been on everyone's mind as it relates to AI is, you know, where's the return on investment coming from? And that's the whole bag of worms for the hyperscalers and the companies that are selling into the data centers and all that stuff. The interesting thing that happened this year, there's been a lot of focus on the science fiction version of AI. When's it going to cure cancer? When's it going to, you know, kind of reach AGI or whatever you want to call it now?  I think, right, that what happened this year essentially is we found a capability gap where the trade is going to broaden out to not about what AI might do in five years, but very much about what it can do already that companies have been lagging and figuring out. So the reality is essentially that if you think of any organization, there's always going to be a subset of the kind of organizational pyramid at the bottom where it's pretty much undifferentiated labor.  And AI progressed in 2025 to the level where the technology to replace that already exists. Not necessarily the people above, let's say the bottom 20%, but any organization has a certain amount of employees that are creating negative value. And there's a huge gap between what AI can do today and what most organizations are actually using it for. And that's where...  I think this new part of the trade lives. And the reason why it's so interesting to me is it's kind of similar to the robotics thesis that we had, which we spoke about where.  The automotive cycle was so bad that you could buy these secular winners from robotics at this kind of cyclical trough price. I can give you a real example. I was talking to a senior person at an unnamed large professional services firm recently, and they were telling me, yeah, we're experimenting with AI. We're letting junior analysts use ChatGPT to summarize PDFs. We're using Quen and all this stuff. But at the same time, think about the standard junior analyst at a banker or consultancy. What's their actual job?  It's not strategizing. It's taking a logo from a PDF, removing the background, aligning it perfectly on a PowerPoint slide at two in the morning so that their MD doesn't yell at them. That is what David Graeber in his book called a quote-unquote bullshit job. He has this great quote about John Maynard Keynes saying in 1930.  By the end of the century, we'll all have a 15-hour work week because technology will have taken us so far that you don't need to be in the office 40 hours a week. And he was right. Technology did progress to that level, but we just created a bunch more work that nobody really needs to do. And there's a lot of people that show up to work, like email jobs, and they don't feel that what they're doing needs to be done. So right now, like at this exact period of time, an AI agent can do that same logo aligning task in four seconds for a fraction of a penny.  But Fortune 500 companies are still paying a guy from Wharton $150,000 a year to do it manually because their own internal bureaucracy hasn't caught up. Technology advances at this exponential curve and human adoption of technologies is relatively linear. So I think that there's a trade there for sure. You want to own the companies that have very bloated organizations and show some intent to cut that down with artificial intelligence.  The interesting part right now that's unique about this exact moment in time, nobody's stopping them from doing that. If you think about the social implications of like mass unemployment or this actually occurring, there's no, eventually that will cause an issue. But right now there's no regulatory blocker. There's no technical logger. It's just that these organizations don't know how to rewire themselves. So you want, when you look at some of these companies like that have been trading like AI losers.  And that's gotten their valuations extremely attractive. If you take the idea of this company might end up being an AI loser. Yes, AI can code now. So maybe you don't need Accenture, maybe you don't need Capgemini, but that's not going to happen overnight. And the ad agencies, Omnicom, WPP, they're not going to get replaced by AI tomorrow, but they can replace a very significant amount of their labor pool with AI today. So looking out across this universe of stocks that could really see a benefit from  organizations realizing that they can finally utilize AI, that it's good enough. When people talk about this adoption being slow, I think that's the wrong framing. The tech adoption is fast, but the organizational adoption is glacial. And there's an interesting universe of stocks that are just very cheap, that are traded like AI losers, and could realistically cut half of their workforce. And SG&A would go down, the margins would go up pretty significantly relative to their peers, and then they'd re-rate. And I think that'll happen in 2026.  If you think of the other interesting angle here is you remember we spent a lot of time in the 2010s talking about the cloud transition. And it was a big deal that companies had all this data that was sitting in analog, whether it's paper or whatever notes. And that cloud transition, we don't talk about it that much anymore, but it never fully happened. So the second that one of these companies manages to utilize AI to cut.  a significant portion of jobs and ends up being fine if not better more lean realizing better margins their competitors are going to say oh we want to do that too and the bottleneck is going to become we don't have that much we're not at the level where we can be able to do that we like the companies that assist with this think about like sap like they haven't gotten any ai premium at all baked in but if you actually think that ai  continues to progress in the way that it has. And you look at the technology and you know it's good enough to do this stuff. I think we're looking at a year where those companies get some of that premium. And it's from a very, from a risk reward perspective, it's pretty attractive because they're already trading like AI losers. What, they're going to lose more? Everyone is already maximally bearish. All the capital has been sucked out into the data center beneficiaries.  I think that looking for those companies, which we did a pretty in-depth screen, we narrowed it down to 30 companies. We did some qualitative stuff too, just looking at which companies are actually already talking about using AI for this. That is going to happen and it'll be a great trade in 26, I think. And how do you...  crystallize this into an actual trade and find those companies. Talk about the screening process you just referenced in terms of finding companies that have a high head count, and you constructed a bureaucracy score, and then we have a kind of dot plot, the AI bureaucracy alpha framework. Basically, it's a process. First, the reason why this trade kind of came about is we were looking at, we did a very naive screen, which is just, let's take the S&P 500.  And let's look at the bottom 10th of companies that had the lowest net income per employee. And that those 50 companies have massively underperformed the S&P 500. So that was interesting to me, but that there's a lot of reasons that you can have low net income per employee. So we said, okay, we got to go a step further. We used first, basically what you want is a company that is spending a lot on employment.  and spending a lot on employment in an inefficient way. Use SG&A as a percent of sales. And then also what you want is this margin optionality. So you want these companies to be able to, within their sector, the sector relative, cut the...  undifferentiated lowest performing labor and be able to increase their margins significantly because they go from the bottom to the top of their field in terms of margin. So we did that. We did like a quantitative screen and then we narrowed it down qualitatively by looking through filtering for companies that are talking about AI or have done headcount reduction already. And then like a really interesting aspect or really interesting area is like insurance brokers, for example. This is like the most paper pushy organization in the entire world.  And there's a lot of employees and there's a lot of people. And I don't want to give up the vibe that I'm rooting for people to lose their jobs. But at the same time, you have to realize that this is going to happen. And when the market's giving you these names of like incredibly reasonable valuations, you got to go for it. So we've narrowed it down to about 30 companies. They're in many different fields. DocuSign, for example, is one of them. And then we threw in some of the names that would help in this transition, like some of the cloud names. It was very interesting while we were writing this IBM acquired Confluent.  So it's a broad 30 names across different sectors. But the thing that they all have in common is they can utilize AI to increase their margins like this year because the work that they have a lot of employees and a lot of those employees are doing closer jobs. Hey, everyone.  You heard us talk about the Citrindex, and I want to take a moment to explain what that is. As the name suggests, it's an index of Citrini's most high conviction ideas at any point in time. And the Citrindex tool is an all-in-one dashboard for tracking that index, as well as over 130 thematic baskets that Citrini and the team have made. Plus, it's updated in real time with instant notifications as prices move and facts change.  The Citrindex is a separate product from the Citrini Research Substack. Up until recently, if you wanted to subscribe to Citrini Research and the Citrindex, you needed to buy them separately. But now you can get Citrini Research and the Citrindex together in one bundle through Substack. Right now, through January 14th, Monetary Matters listeners can get an exclusive 25% discount on this bundle. You'll get access to the classic Citrini Research that we've all come to love and the Citrindex subscription.  Visit citriniresearch.com slash mmjack to access the offer. Just make sure that you're signed into Substack or enter your email to unlock the special discounted landing page. If you aren't signed in, you can't access the special offer. Remember that's citriniresearch.com slash mmjack. Let's get back into it. I'm just trying to see the dot plot. On the x-axis, it is companies that have a high overhead right now. And the y-axis is the optionality to  increase their efficiency. So a company that's a classic example would be these consulting companies like Accenture or Booz Allen Hamilton. So Booz Allen Hamilton, that also has a DC factor involved in that because everyone thought, okay, Doge is going to happen and all of these government contractors are going to get totally destroyed. That never really happened. But so Accenture, I know that there was a while where they actually were seeing a very large increase in their revenues from AI.  but the stock had not been training well at all. What's going on in Accenture? And exactly, that is what you refer to in the piece as a people factory, a company that's just extremely employee heavy. Listen, you know, probably both, everyone's kind of guilty of this, where in the beginning, all you really needed to outperform because of AI was a conviction that we were going to do it. And then you said, okay, well, if we're going to do what we need, we need the data centers.  and everything has been a derivative of that and i did that too and that's been great and is that going to keep happening yeah probably i i do think that there's something to be said about 2026 maybe being the year that algorithmic improvements start to compete with just like raw compute but that's been the trade and it's been a great trade and i the reason why we included this specific trade in this piece is because that probably will continue but at the same time it sucked a lot of capital  It's become such a no-brainer and so easy that there are a lot of companies out there that just have not gotten a second look. Like you said, Accenture, they've cut jobs. They've spoken about AI improving their margins. AI keeps getting better. I don't know if you've used Gemini to create images, but it nails it. It doesn't really get text wrong. I think you create 10, maybe one has a slight error, and fixing it is as easy as just saying, hey, can you fix this? And it does it.  You go from 10 people each individually working on this being managed by one guy to the manager and the manager just manages the AI agents. And the thing last year, why this wasn't really going to happen was the hallucination rate was just unacceptable. And there's still been some enterprise resistance to that, but you look at like Google's TPUs, right? They're deterministic and Gemini has a much lower rate of hallucination because of that.  People haven't taken a second look at this. And that happens all the time in markets, especially when there's an easy way to make money that doesn't require looking at these areas. And I think if you're not looking at this, you're doing yourself a disservice because we're not going to spend trillions of dollars on creating the infrastructure and then just be like, cool, done.  All right, but we're spending a trillion dollars and we're going to get to AGI and then AGI happens and overnight everyone loses their jobs. Okay, that's not how it's going to happen. It's not how technology works. The trade here, you know, it's not the AI takes your job tomorrow. The trade is companies in 2026 will slowly realize they've been paying humans to do things that computers are already better at and can already do at a fraction of the cost. And historically, when that realization spreads.  It's an interesting time for society and for shareholders. The pushback to this is, well, every time that there's a new technology, new jobs get created because of that technology. You look at Excel, for example, it got rid of the actuarial profession, but it pretty much created the profession of investment analyst. But there's always a gap. You don't have the Luddites being mad unless people first lose their job before those new jobs get created. And I think that we're in that period for the gap to occur now.  And you put this trade first in your piece that you must have a pretty high degree of confidence, a higher degree of confidence, I should say. What about this view? What about the backlash to this, James? Because, you know, I actually kind of wanted to save this for last or not talk about it because I wanted to avoid, you know, kind of making people angry about everyone's going to lose their job. It's not a happy thought at all. You know, I think it's kind of a...  maybe a bad thing, but that doesn't really matter in the investment business, I guess. Yeah, I mean, like, I'm not rooting for people to lose their jobs. But again, we spend a trillion dollars on a technology, and the sole purpose of that technology is to replace people. And as it gets better, there's a whole other aspect of the societal implications. And could we see an economy in 2026 where  The unemployment rate continues going up, but stocks also continue going up. That's happened before plenty of times in history. A good example is like after World War II, you had all the GIs come back, the unemployment rate was very high, but the stock market continued to do well. It's remnant, you know, March of 2024, we wrote a piece about how to play Trump winning the presidential election. And yeah, half the people that read that were like, nope, I don't like this.  When you're an investor, you have to separate what you want to happen versus what's in front of your face and likely going to happen. And it's something where the reason why it's up front is because there are a couple of things we could be wrong on. Maybe the stock market continues to just play the easiest thing, which is NVIDIA and the supply chain and all these other things that we talked about, like advanced packaging and the bottlenecks towards making compute capable of doing AGI.  And eventually, no matter what, if you're spending it, like this will happen. And it's a good idea to be prepared as an investor for what that looks like when that does happen. And it's also got a macro angle of just, are we going to see the unemployment rate rise? And I can see it very clearly if in the beginning, when that starts happening and the unemployment, it might already be happening. The unemployment rate is rising. People are getting increasingly bearish, but then companies keep posting excellent earnings.  like that that's something that's very likely to happen and it's something that you should be aware of so that's why we live with it because it's everyone i think deep down knows that this is going to happen nobody that's using ai with any regularity doesn't witness the improvements doesn't notice that it's doing more of the things that they would be doing themselves  It's controversial, but there might have to be, with every new technology, there's a change to some degree of the social structure. And that's beyond my IQ, what society looks like in that world, but it's something that probably should be thought about. And what about the counter case that actually AI is just a parlor trick and it can't be used for real knowledge work? It's just...  taking ideas not generating new ones and then in particular it there's a reason that it hasn't been picked up in the enterprise for individuals sure but for enterprise not so much because you reference the hallucination rate interestingly i've always been a gemini user so i've i've seen hallucinations a few times but not nearly as often as people are talking about yeah i think that when you're investing in technology changes pretty quickly um  And we've seen a lot of changes this year. And you have to update your priors when those changes occur. I would just say, show me a time in history where we put this much capital into something. It didn't at least make it better. We're putting more capital in this relative than we did getting humans to the moon. You can be on the other side of that and say that it's a parlor trick, sure. But it's not. But even if it was.  You throw enough money at something and eventually it doesn't become a parlor trick anymore. It becomes reality. And even if the stock market becomes disillusioned with it, the technology will continue to go forward. And that's what's so compelling about looking for opportunities that are mispriced like this. Because when you think about the dot-com bubble, for example, I don't necessarily think that we're repeating the dot-com bubble or that we're far along in that pathway yet.  But when you think about the dot-com bubble, the biggest strides in the technology were made while the bubble was bursting. It concentrated capital into more efficient uses. There was a bunch of capacity that was there for the taking, for people that were building things. If that were to occur, you look at how a lot of these names find themselves in value factor or in low volatility factor. And if you have this top of mind and you're monitoring it throughout the year.  if there is some sort of scare these names will probably go down a lot less or they even go up because they're improving their margins so yeah i would say to that uh parlor trick uh it it's an uninformed take and those people will get their day right they'll get their day where they say i told you look it's like the stock market's down that means the ai isn't a thing but it will be and it will continue to accelerate and if you're not preparing for that it could be a rude awakening  So, James, I'd categorize the basket of companies that could shed their workforce and increase their earnings and productivity because of AI. I'd say that is a trade that is a result of AI trade rather than a CapEx trade. When you came on my previous show in 2023 talking about AI and everyone was a skeptic,  You were all talking about NVIDIA, the semiconductors, maybe the companies around the semiconductors, the data center. Now it seems you're focused more on companies that actually are going to use AI rather than the CapEx. You still have some CapEx names. So, James, I mentioned that yet again in 2025, yet another year of Citroën X has beaten the S&P. However, don't you think it would have been better to just...  trade the CapEx names? All these memory names are going crazy. You probably were long those names in 2023 and 2024, but has the pivot from the CapEx into the beneficiaries from phase one to phase two, is that a mistake? Might we still be in phase one? Absolutely. If you go and you load up our AI basket, it's about 30 or 35 names. Throughout the year, we did own Micron. We owned SK Hynix. We owned...  keoxia and and the names that benefit from this increasing need for both storage and memory and that basket i don't have exact numbers but i'm pretty sure it was up like 70 or 80 a year a day so the yeah it should have been sized larger but at the same time it is a the risk right if you look at how it did in april right it wasn't that that obviously an opportunity to buy the dip which we did but there the risk can it will continue to increase and it's the  In investing in the infrastructure, yes, it's been a great trade. It probably will continue to be a great trade, but it does have an expiration date, I think. And I'm not smart enough to know whether that's this year or five years from now. So I think you do stay allocated to it and you do continue to really the trade in AI infrastructure has been.  much more about monitoring for bottlenecks than it has been about just going for whatever we need to build, because that's constantly changing. And now you have another idea that we speak about in this is advanced packaging has become the bottleneck. And we'll talk about that in a second. But to answer your question, yeah, we probably should have sized up a little bit more in these first phase infrastructure buildout names in 2025. But you do.  need to start thinking about a margin of safety. And if that means that you put a portion of your, I really am a fan of like the tracker position, like same with Peter Lynch, you know, you have 1400 stocks and you would just buy stuff to put it on a screen. I think it's a really good idea to put this on your screen. And then if the tide starts changing and you see these names outperforming, that's like, okay, because this second phase will happen. And we were definitely like early to that, but it's going to happen.  like the infrastructure you every time you have an infrastructure build eventually you get a capacity and i think we'll get that too here i don't think that'll occur in 2026 but you should really be focused on just in the infrastructure layer you look at the bottlenecks memory is a huge one advanced packaging is another one and then  I do think it's a good idea to start broadening out a little bit in terms of who's going to, this is a real technology net and we're going to keep building it, but also it's been built to a degree that is pretty useful. I think that, yeah, so just looking at the.  contribution of the P&L. Yeah, the dynamic AI basket was up 70% this year. Interestingly, the biggest contributor was shorting the VanEck semiconductor ETF. Yeah, that was a good one. The deep seek thing. Yeah, that's good. I don't know that many investors who made money shorting semiconductors this year. I had a great conversation this year with Peter Borish, who was at Tudor.  it when like the 1987 crash and and they they nailed it right and and he was the guy that was like making the analog between the 20s and that helped him be prepared for that and when i started talking i said man i just gotta ask you and you could see the look on his face he's like this guy's gonna ask me how i predicted the 87 crash again and i was like how did you convince yourself to go long at the at the lows because that is so much more difficult if you think about it like like especially if you're  write about like a market event like that, where you have a huge drawdown and you make money from it, convincing yourself to get back in is way more difficult. That's the kind of the similar thing that happened with you, where I thought that it represented this broadening out. And for a month, made a ton of money shorting SMH on that, pretty covered it pretty much near the lows. But then...  started looking at these kind of, what about names that aren't semiconductors? And, you know, so, so it's a double-edged sword to do that. But I do think the valuations are getting too attractive and the opportunity is getting too obvious where the profit incentive to utilize AI is going to become a driver and the infrastructure, I mean.  There's been a lot of money spent and you start having to ask yourself, you do need to see adoption. And I do think that we will see adoption and it will drive more money going. Both of these things can do well at the same time. It's just a matter of continuing to be solely focused on the infrastructure buildout has a lot more risk than starting to think about two steps ahead. But there are places in that infrastructure buildout that are pretty reasonable still. The advanced packaging that we were talking about. We will get to advanced packaging. I just want to remind our viewers that  i'm looking at the attribution of all this baskets and the citrindex that is available in a package deal the citrindex and the citrini sub stack in one bundle for 25 off to monetary matters listeners until january 14th james talk to me about advanced packaging i literally before i read this i thought you were talking about some sort of really fancy box for a dps or a fedex so i'm such a luddite but what kind of companies are we talking about here  What's the theme? Why is it so important for custom silicon as well as maybe NVIDIA 2? That's the advanced packaging. It is what it says, right? It's packaging these chips in a way that basically for 50 years, if you're familiar with Moore's Law, we made transistors smaller. And that worked great. And then we hit a wall where chips, we could make them bigger to fit all this stuff.  We can't make them any bigger. They won't fit on the lithography machines. It's called the reticle limit. So if you try to print a chip bigger than that, you know, the yields collapse, you lose money. So the new game isn't make the chip bigger. It's make a bunch of small chips, which are adorably called chiplets and, you know, stitch them together. So they act one big chip and that stitching is advanced packaging. And, you know, it's, it's.  This is an interesting bottleneck for me because it's been a bottleneck for a while. If you've heard about co-host from TSMC, that's been a big capacity constraint in making as many GPUs as possible. But the reason why this is interesting to me now with names like Amcor and some of the supply chain, like the tooling and stuff like that, we saw Google come out with these TPUs or they've been doing the TPU, but the TPUs got good enough to deliver a model that was state VR.  That's not going to be the last piece of custom silicon that we see. If Google is competing with NVIDIA with TPUs, or if Meta makes their own chip, or if NVIDIA launches Blackwell, all of these need advanced packaging, and they're all fighting for the same exact capacity. TSMC is the only one doing it at scale, and they are completely tapped out. And the names that are taking their overflow capacity, like ASE technology, they trade at a much more reasonable valuation than, say, NVIDIA.  There's another name that might be controversial, but Intel, right? Intel's been dead for a while. They keep squaring up. But Intel's foundry business might be a mess, but their packaging technology, which, you know, EMIB, which there's basically, if you think about packaging a bunch of small chips together, there's only so many ways to do it, right?  because there's only so many ways to stack stuff you can either do in two dimensions where you just put it on the chip and then drill through it or you can do it in three dimensions where you stack things on top of each other and then stack them on top of the chip and it looks like a cube their advanced packaging emid is their 2.5 dimension which is just two dimension basically it's a marketing thing and foveros is three dimension it's becoming the first kind of real relief valve for this massive bottleneck  There's already rumors that Apple and the hyperscalers are looking at Intel just for this packaging layer. So the trade for advanced packaging has these tailwinds from on one hand, you get upside to this increase. Companies don't want to pay the Nvidia tax anymore. So they develop their own custom silicon. And then at the same time it's additive. So if Nvidia sells more chips.  this advanced packaging does still this complex still does well and so like amcor it's a boring steady has some exposure to mobile it's increasingly picking up the volumes that intel or tsmc are too busy to handle and then if you really don't want to own intel you could buy the guys that are like selling them the staplers a company called the kulik and sofa  I don't think I'm pronouncing that, but the tickers click tail, I see they make this specialized kind of tools that bond these chiplets together. I think everyone kind of frames this as a binary thing, either Google wins or Nvidia wins or a Chinese ASIC wins or it right now, at least it's all additive. So I think they're betting on like the duct tape, holding the chip together rather than who wins the chip war is probably a good idea here.  so we've got a chart and i like how you make this very simple actually it's colors of my high school so i like it even more but that over time the share of incremental performance from chips mostly it came from in the old days it came from the orange the transistor scalar so basically the chip being more efficient and now it's coming from the blue the system level integration the chiplets the high bandwidth memory hbm and the co-packaged  a cell so it's not about fitting as many little tiny little things on the chip anymore it's increasingly becoming about connecting the chick the chip within the ecosystem is that what's called what internet interconnect means yeah you need yeah you need interconnect so basically you need all these chiplets to talk to each other you know so so yeah you did and and uh that's um yeah it's kind of interesting once you start like uh like really you're like oh advanced packaging it's packaging stuff together advancedly  Like, you know, it's like, oh, interconnects. It's connecting stuff. Enter. You know, the obvious, obviously, if you want to be an investor in this stuff, unless you want to go the route of like literally becoming a semiconductor designer so that you can understand this, that's like more power to you. I would much rather understand it from speak to people that are super smart and then try to make it understandable to someone that's not like myself. And so in terms of the core.  companies for this advanced packaging the core longs you call them intel amcore synopsis klic and besi tell us about synopsis later on in the 26 piece you wrote a one name piece just on synopsis and then also besi that's that company so synopsis basically synopsis is another winner of this custom silicon drive this aversion to the nvidia tags this idea that companies can only maintain  massive gross margins for so long and it's got an interesting story because it was punished for a pretty long time on the intel but the elevator pitch is basically you can't do like like this is called eda and ip so basically they own the ip of chip design and you can't build a modern chip without them it costs like 750 million dollars to design a leading edge chip now  You're not drawing it on a napkin. You need to, you need this EDA, electronic design automation software to simulate every electron before you spend even a dollar manufacturing it. And this is essentially a duopoly or a triopoly. You have Synopsys, Cadence, and Mentor, which is owned by Siemens. And Synopsys specifically has gotten beaten down because they had a massive contract to help Intel port designs to their 18A node. Intel cleaned house.  brought in Lip Bhutan to look at the books. He realized that Intel was basically paying for an ecosystem that didn't exist yet and just rug pulled the contract. Synopsis had to eat the loss because you can't upset your, one of your biggest customers. The stock went down like 40% and the market started pricing it like.  It's this structural flaw, but it's a contract dispute. Intel's still a huge customer. Intel is improving. Intel's going to need more EDA and IP. They'll eventually pay back those fees because they need Synopsys to make their 18A node work. And if you look at the valuation gap between Cadence and Synopsys, Cadence is like a 45 times earnings. Synopsys is a 30. Synopsys also did a great acquisition with Ansys, which is like the physics simulator.  with so it's it which is benefiting from these advancements in ai and also enabling these advancements in ai which i think is pretty poetic and like we talked about earlier that this advanced packaging 2d or 3d like as we move towards three-dimensional making these cubes of chiplets you can't just code the logic anymore you have to simulate the physics so heat dissipation warping melting by owning  synopsis and synopsis owning ansys they're they position themselves to become the physics engine and you're basically buying what's what can really be thought of as a monopoly at a huge discount because of a like breakup is it like a little bit expensive yeah trades of software multiple it's asset light and it's a huge discount taken and so i think that synopsis is a great play for 2026. so that is a play for the packaging of the actual chip the trade idea right after that is something that got me really excited because  Early on, you had this infographics about a picks and shovels play on AI. And whenever you talked about a picks and shovels play on AI, it tends to have worked out well. This is something, James, I've actually been looking at myself. I've just been asking Gemini, what are some commodity materials that are making AI? It turns out silicon is extremely available. There's not going to be a shortage of the actual silicon. There's a lot of sand on Earth. But what...  could there be a potential shortage of? And what could there be a potential buying in the cycle where the stocks aren't priced, have no AI premium at all, and yet they are producing a commodity or a material or a service that is going to be in great demand for this AI buildup? So this gets way more nerdy. The trade here is basically...  You have a bunch of companies that are essentially commodity companies that are putting the kind of materials into, if you think about the GPU as like the brain, these guys are like building the skull and the spine and everything that goes into it. And a lot of these bottlenecks that get discussed, they're digital scaling running into physics.  And if you look at the way that this has progressed, we seemingly always have a bottleneck somewhere, whether it's like in a certain resin or a type of glass. So a lot of these companies have done really well. You can split them up kind of like oil and gas. You have upstream, midstream, downstream. And downstream ones, like the PCB names, like Celestica, which make the boards to put these chips onto, they've done great.  And then midstream's done a little less great and upstream's done not so hot. PCB stands for printed circuit board. And yeah, Celestial was a stock that you had such high conviction in. You actually wrote a single name piece on it and were very long it. Yeah, that was a great one. It's 17 bucks. I think it's 300 something now. I sold it already, but God, that was a mistake. But so looking at some of these like chemical or like material companies.  If you look at the media out of like Japan and Taiwan, they're all talking about these shortages in, you know, not to like bore you, but like BT resin, tea glass, like non-conductive film probably. And it's all stuff where like non-conductive film, for example, when you stack those high bandwidth memory chips that you need for any AI accelerator, you got to glue them together.  And you got to gloom with something that doesn't conduct electricity, but conducts heat. There's a company called Resinac that has like 100% market share on that film. And the, you look at, and when these companies, which are priced like chemical or gas companies experience this positioning as like the.  Only thing that we need more of. They do tend to increase capacity. Their stock also goes up 350%. Look at the Tobo in Japan. They make, they make tea glass fiber, which is a special type of glass that doesn't expand when it gets hot. And they have a 70% market share. You add, you can't build a high end AI server board without this tea glass.  That stock has absolutely killed it. So it's interesting to look at that and say, where else might there be bottlenecks? Maybe these bottlenecks continue. So we created like a watch list of categorizations. Here's, you need this BT resin, you need non-conductive film, you need this, that, and the other thing. And some of them won't have bottlenecks. Some of them are very commoditized and it's easy for competitors to increase capacity. Some of them will. And watching that in 2026 will be increasingly important. An interesting one that I liked a lot. You remember MSG?  Not Madison Square Garden, but like when you order Chinese food in like the early 2000s, you're like, no MSG please. Yeah. So there's a company called Ajinomoto, which makes MSG. And they also make the quote unquote buildup film, ABF substrate, if you want to be like a huge nerd. And that's like the insulation layer. They have a 90% global market share.  And so it's, and guess what? They trade like they make MSG. So they're boring. They're buried in the chemical sector. And if you look at this supply chain, the closer you get to the AI box, the box that you can touch, the better the stock is done. Look at like outside of the actual GPU, you look like Vertiv or Victory Giant, like you said, Celestica, TTMI, the server racks, SMCI for a little bit, not anymore. As you go upstream from that.  the guys that are like mixing the resin or there's still a lot of them that are trading at these cyclical chemical multiples and you have a really good proof of concept in something like nitobo which traded like that and then everyone said whoa we need a lot of tea glass and so i think the trade here is much more interesting like the midstream maybe the upstream if you want to be like if you want to play the upstream you got to be really on top of  monitoring these bottlenecks but the midstream is benefiting from both sides just keeping like a news alert on like country taiwan or japan word shortage like that that i think that that and then you know once you hit one of those you don't have to be like a again you don't be a semi-engineer you just go load up 26 trades and you hit one and it comes through and it says hey tantalum there's a tantalum shortage okay control that tantalum  uh and it looks it'll show you know okay so 10 limb capacitors are made by murata manufacturer okay cool done that that's it's something this happened to murata in i think it was 2021 too where they said we have all these crypto mining gpus and a crypto and these crypto mining asics and these they use 10 or 100 i might be off my order magnitude as many times of these limb capacitors than normal chips  And it was the most severe shortage because of crypto mining that we've ever had. Looking at something like that. And then if they start talking about, ah, we need these guys to make more of them. You find a company that has 170 to 100% market share. And that can go on for a lot longer in this environment than people think. And so you're looking at companies like, yeah, Notobo, but in particular, Resinac. That seems to be the company that you had the most high conviction in. So, yeah, basically.  Resenac has the most shots on goal here, where Resenac has a lot of areas that go into the AI supply chain. There aren't any that are like really in severe shortages yet. But basically, if there's going to be a shortage like in the midstream eruption, Resenac has the highest kind of likelihood having a significant market share in that area. So again, it comes down to this is a watch list. You can play the existing shortages, but I would just...  worn like these companies still are commoditized they still make their companies that are making things they're turning raw materials into stuff and the companies that are some of them selling raw materials like if that bottleneck gets resolved these companies gonna have 50 you know so so it's much i think this is a trade where you can put it on and take the risk of i think that these architectures won't change that much and we're going to keep needing whatever it is whether like tea glass will probably need more of it we're also like  you could look like glass substrates and stuff like that but you could also just say this is a great watch list and i'm going to just wait until because the the best way to be early to a trade is to just actually be paying attention to something just paying attention a good example like it's 2022 chat gpt you say okay i'm going to pay attention to what it takes to run this model or to train this model or you know whatever to deliver this product and  You say, okay, it's GPUs. And then you start seeing everybody talking about buying GPUs. Okay, I'm going to buy NVIDIA. And that was an easy one. And now that's the most obvious thing in the world. You got to start saying, okay, well, what are people not really paying attention to? And for me, at least, like before I did this research, I didn't really know about build-up film or ABF substrates. And that's fair, but I'm sure there are a lot of people that are listening that might know about that. They might be engineers.  For me, it's easy enough to just monitor these shortages. And once there is one, you buy the companies. And again, if you look in the tow boat, it's been going up every single day for eight months. And you look at the first headline about the shortage of tea glass and it's eight months ago. So you got to track the shortages. In terms of actual demand for commodity, things like copper, maybe silver, but also natural gas. Where do you think the biggest  potential for the price going up could be. I know that you're getting increasingly interested in the natural gas area. And in your model portfolio, this is Trendex, that actually is a major theme. Why have you gotten so bullish on natural gas, a commodity that is famous for the supply being able to just go up a lot? Yeah. So we're bullish on, in the commodity space, we're bullish on copper and natural gas. Copper is a little bit of a simpler story.  But they both have the same kind of thing where you don't necessarily have this belief that this cycle could result in any short sort of kind of competition or any sort of like struggling to get supply online. And the thing about the copper might be the easier long natural gas. And we do own a bunch of copper miners and we have for a while on that thesis. But natural gas is much more interesting to me because it's.  Like nobody believes it. And I get it. And you can look at, we published our thing on natural gas in September. Natural gas went from sub $3 to like above five and then it got caught in half. And it's, yeah, like natural gas trades on the weather because it's the only thing that people care about in the front month. The opportunity here is basically, if you have the, if you believe in the idea that like this LNG export capacity will come online and it'll start competing with the data centers that like.  nuclear is great solar is great i get it you should probably we're going to use that too but we got to build machine god now most of these things are being run on natural gas and we're building so many of them and it's going to start having a competition with this other huge mega trend in infrastructure construction which is lng export terminals and the u.s used to import lng and now we're going to become where we are the largest export so  I think that the trade, again, the trade is not, I got a lot of people when we wrote a lot of calls on like Comstock, which like great trade. Okay. That worked for a few months. And then the trade is you own these companies like EQT or Comstock or, and with the idea that like the back end of the curve will still be super volatile because it's natural gas. That's just how the commodity works. But that volatility will trend upwards.  Because you'll need, like, the excuse of the Permian will just bring on capacity forever. I think, like, that's definitely how it's priced. And you don't have a ton of downside from that being the case. But you do have a lot of upside from that starting to get challenged. I think probably in the next year, if you were, do you remember, like, the IPPs, like Vistra? So the big thing that happened with them that was, like, so amazing.  and got all these growth investors to start putting a growth multiple on it was they started offering power like fixed price contract to piper scholars you're talking about independent power producers like vista constellation which unlike regulated utilities where oh i'm going to the government to get my five percent price increase approved like they can just charge whatever they want and they're not very regulated and you were early in talking about those and investing in those but yeah yeah and you and you see like what you know like like  but something that's basically a utility in early 24, start trading with a beta of one to Nvidia. And that's cool. Like the, cause that's a massive re-rating and really the driving factor there was this, like if you're a hyperscaler, you're worried about power costs, you're worried about power volatility and Vistra is worried about the same thing. And Vistra says, okay, we'll offer you a fixed price contract on power for the next XMA. And what that enables is growth investors then can say, okay,  i'm not really taking a view on like the commodity pricing of power i'm taking a view on like hyperscalers using more of it and i can put a multiple on that because there's a and i think that in 2026 what we'll see those hyperscalers will probably negotiate fixed price contracts for natural gas with like eqt has already talked about this a little bit it hasn't happened yet but once that happens the natural gas equities will  I think trade better. And then so it's the trade is basically one natural gas is going to keep powering our efforts towards AGI until, until we can do cold fusion. And then on the other hand, the natural gas producers are going to be able to negotiate things with hyperscalers that allow their investor base to broaden out and get more of this growth investor in there. And it's a similar, but not identical story for copper, which most of the guys that are like,  trading copper futures they're not going to believe this like ai super cycle bull case but we have a real line in there about like how much it would cost to build a new escondita and when it would come online and it's massive and it takes forever so it's a giant copper mine yeah yeah yeah and and um so that's another those two commodities are interesting to me cover obviously has been the easier trade natural gas will kick you in the nuts a few times but i think it's also uh similar  opportunity of bridging this kind of secular trend. Have you looked into silver using AI? I missed silver. Alex Campbell was talking about it for a while and absolutely nailed it. And I had that like weird psychological like anchoring bias that you get sometimes where I had a whole article ready about the gold miners and then I decided not to publish it.  I decided not to put the trade on and I really should have and it soured me on precious metals. And I just missed the silver trade entirely. I would say if you are interested in that, you should definitely go read what Alex Campbell is writing about because he's been 100% right and I totally miss it. So that's the macro thesis for natural gas. I'm looking at Citrindex. You have all of these names in your natural gas.  basket. One of them, I will say, is Texas Pacific Land Corp, a company that I just think is fantastic. But why so diversified if the core exposure for most of these companies is the same? What is the advantage of natural gas producer A versus natural gas producer B? It's interesting. So the biggest weights are Comstock and EQT. But there's a lot of really interesting opportunities in Canadian natural gas, which has been a nightmare. And that's so...  It's very much an approach of casting a wide nap because this would be such like this thesis working out.  which again, this is like a longer term thesis, right? It's great that natural gas went up a ton after we published and that the winter was cold. Our thesis is not that the winters are getting cold. That's if anything like the thesis was like people have gotten a little complacent about the winter being cold and sometimes the winter is cold, but it's such a, it would be such a shift for the market to not be priced. Like the Permian can just infinity ramp to meet all these demands for natural gas that, and then in the meantime, like if that isn't the case, if the downside, like relatively limited, especially from where we got in.  So it's something where it's like a broader net of you have the upstream Comstock and EQT. And then you also have some of the Canadian ones, which like are super cheap and whichever one, and that's a political aspect too. But whichever ones start doing well, those are the ones I add into. And like the, and it's, it's a fixed pie, right? So it's not like we're like martingaling into natural gas, but the equity is doing increasing. It's also.  This is like even more heretical than talking about natural gas, but I do own a couple of regulated utilities as well, which is like insane. For a long time, I've never touched, like my kind of framework was like financials and utilities. They're these industries where everything's okay. And then one day you wake up and everything's really not okay. But some of them really.  if you look at excel for example i had a discussion with a company that's working with them called form they're private and the concept of there's been real really no incentive to allow  these utilities to increase their capacity or to do CapEx spending and, you know, and with the data center stuff, like there's going to be backlash and there's going to be a real kind of drive to, to, to change the political landscape, to get them to be able to do that and to sell more so that prices don't go up on like households. So it's, that's a super, it's a very left tail or right tail event type thing. But I do think that it could change a little bit in 26.  So talking about a potential supply squeeze because of AI demand is going to be so high. So copper, silver, natural gas. What about this thing you call post-traumatic supply disorder, PTSD, where the cyclical markets have suffered for a long time of building up inventory and only to lead to a cyclical crash that they are avoiding investing in the capital?  expenditure. The most obvious theme right now would be natural gas turbines. So like to even know or Siemens talk about that. Yeah. So basically last year, when we wrote 25 trades, the second trade was crouching tigers, hidden dragons, which basically the thesis was started from the insight of what can we extrapolate from the names that have done really well into insight about what's going to do well next year.  And we looked at like Carvana and Appleben and Unity and the kind of common thread between all these, which we talked about on our last podcast, 25 Trades, was that they had done so much in terms of, they had built so much infrastructure, not like necessarily physical infrastructure, but they had used the zero interest rate policy environment to create this moat that would be incredibly difficult for new challengers to come up against.  in environment where interest rates are 5%. And then at the same time, they'd gone down 90% from their highs in 21 and lost their investor base. And everyone viewed them as like a bad word and nobody really wanted to own them. So it was hated and, but also benefiting from this, a bunch of cheap money that they had used to build great infrastructure. And that did very well in 25. So we went back to the well of inspiration to  Think about, okay, what else did, what did really well in 2026? And was there any common thread between them? So you've got, you have memory, Micron, SK Hynix, and NAND, like Keoxia, Sandus, Western Dig. You've got the gas turbine companies, and both of those sectors absolutely murdered it this year. And when you look at them, you say, well, some of the best companies in the world in terms of stock performance, yeah.  Yeah. And you look at them, you say, you can take the easy way out and say, okay, it's AI exposure. But there's a lot of companies that have AI exposure that didn't end up being the best performing companies of the year. So I think that if you think about it, like what is the kind of commonality between these? These companies had over the past five to 10 years that these big cycles where they ramped capacity into it to meet what they thought was like secular demand. And then they got absolutely screwed by doing that.  And now they're reticent. They're not as gung ho. And eventually they will increase capacity, but at least for the past year, they were pretty much content to let their backlogs grow. The average selling prices go up. And so it's like PTSD, right? Like once bitten, twice shy. So we call it post-traumatic supply disorder, which is they listened to a bullish forecast. They built a new factory or they built a new whatever unit of capacity. They spent billions, demand fell off a cliff. And now they're just.  okay we're not going to do that again and it's been a pretty volatile environment for cyclicals over the past five years so these like wounds are fresh and in both those areas demand came back for things like data center power or high bandwidth memory or dram or nand and  In a normal kind of textbook world, these companies rush to build new factories to capture that market share from that demand, but they aren't. Yes, like right now, some of them are planning on increasing capacity, but look at GE Renova, right? They're projecting their EBITDA margins to go to 20% over the next two years from 14. From 14. Yeah. And because they're like hypervigilant, they're not believing the hockey stick charts. They're hoarding their backlog. They're like, they're treating debt like a  STD that they got in college, like the, and it's interesting to say, okay, where else could this play out? And the screen basically that we use is, okay, first you need this trauma to exist. Then you need, then you need there to be some sort of increased demand. And then you need there to be some sort of capital discipline. And also you need it to be an oligopoly.  Right. So one that like meets the first three is any of the gold miners, right? That like they have the first three, but they're not, but like the capacity can get brought on by any of their competitors. Right. It's very, it's not a concentrated market. So some areas that are interesting to look at from this perspective, like solar, for example, analog, analog semis, wind turbines, offshore drillers, like these all had like each one of those things that I just said, there's a very good case for like why they shouldn't do well.  But if low margins, high capex and very cyclical and a tendency of the CEOs in the business to be wildly optimistic and the stereotype of the oil CEO who just loves to drill, drill holes and borrow as much money to drill as many holes as possible. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, and then but you have, you know, like for solar, you got like.  China's doing anti-involution, which is like, they're like, hey guys, let's stop doing this like race to the bottom where we just try to flood the market with as much capacity as possible. There's a national security element where they're not, the US isn't necessarily buying Chinese made solar. And you've also, you've got like the beginnings of like green shoots for demand with like, you are using solar as well for AI data centers and rates are going down. So maybe we see some return with the residential.  Yeah, then you look at a company like First Solar and if this de facto becomes a oligopoly because we're restricted from buying China and then demand goes up and they don't, they're so burned by what happened before that they don't immediately increase capacity. That could be really good for their average selling prices and it could be really good for their stock. And it's an area that's similar. I mean, so like I said, the gold miners don't necessarily fit this because even though they have demand, they're not being relatively disciplined.  they're not an oligopoly but if you look at lithium it's still commodity they're not necessarily price they're not price makers they're taking price from the commodity set but it is pretty concentrated right like the amount of players in this for mining at least it's pretty concentrated and all of them have gone through this trauma so it like something like sqm or or you know uh alebra which used to be piedmont like like the there is a  potential there for the same dynamic to play out. We basically created a screen and we split into four seconds. It's pretty much represented by analog semis, solar. There's some offshore drillers in there. There's some lithium and there's some one-off companies like in like probe cards and stuff that aren't necessarily- What's that? Prope? What?  pro cards yeah techno probe in in italy like there are just one-offs from like individual sectors that meet all these criteria and we did like i think that we will see at least one or two  areas where this plays out again in in 2026 and i also think that the areas where it did play out in 2025 continue and it's probably a good idea to watch for when that capacity gets really ramped up again the when the sk hynix and micron start acting like the oil company ceos just drill baby drill make as much as we possibly can that'll be  probably closer to the end than the beginning, but we're in gas turbines too. We're not seeing it from Siemens or GE Vernova. They're not ramping that capacity. They have demand that's projected to double. A decade ago, this company would have said, okay, three new factories, let's go. And today they're like, we're going to do like a tiny cautious capacity bump. And then we're going to raise our margin targets massively. And they're just scared to death of overbuilding. And that's great for the stock. And so you  had a framework of three things whether it's oligopoly score it's a demand score and it's discipline score and we can put up right now the dot plot we'll call it of on the x-axis the degree to which it's a price maker and then on the y-axis the degree to which it has capacity restraints so for example like newmont a gold miner has very high on both but it's not an oligopoly you point out that  quite correctly the precious metals miner is quite diversified i didn't know until reading your piece that lithium was very concentrated in terms of production i have ptsd not so much for investing myself but just doing interviews on lithium where it was just pitched as this is like digital gold and it's powering thing and then i probably did those interviews at the peak in lithium prices and you know i mean people were pitching um  that Piedmont stock that changed its name. There's a reason it had to change its name. So I just feel kind of cautious, but maybe my caution is, is the post-traumatic supply disorder that you're talking about. So maybe that kind of proves the point. Yeah. And you know, that it's the same thing. Like you could have just as easily have done that interview. Maybe you did, I don't know, but about Carvana in 2021 and looking at how that did it's like, like the, so yeah, I guess you,  always starting from a place of what was hated this year and then started ripping? And what would it take for it to continue going up? And then what else is similar to this that could, if one thing changes that I can track, could experience the same kind of dynamic? All right, James, now I want to talk about, it's not 26 trades, but it is an idea, a debate that is animating the market right now, which is the degree to which  Google can beat everyone else just by building its own TPUs, Tensor Processing Unit. So it doesn't need NVIDIA GPUs or the CPUs. It's building its own infrastructure. Maybe Google is going to be selling TPUs to external parties. And also Google with its Gemini can beat OpenAI. And basically the business model of investing hundreds of billions of dollars in building out capacity.  and buying NVIDIA chips, you don't need to do that because Google can be way more cost effective. In other words, we've all seen the famous chart from KOTU of how Google ecosystem is beating out an AI ecosystem. Not that open AI is publicly traded. Microsoft has exposure to open AI. So like Google has been crushing Microsoft just in terms of shared performance. The other dichotomy is the degree to which companies can be need to buy NVIDIA chips or AMD chips.  versus custom ASICs. And you've been talking about this for two years, but I guess now it's really at the foray. But just talking about that first topic, like you had a piece on the Citrini Substack about, I think it was called carving out the TPU, really good piece. Your thoughts here on where are you on this debate? Again, it's something where the market views it very much as binary. It's like you're either bullish on Indeed or you're bullish on Google.  We were bullish on Google because it was treated as an AI loser when it was very obviously a winner. And then a couple of things went right along that timeline and it did really well. And we will continue to see this happen. We will continue to see the like reluctance to pay the NVIDIA tax leading to hyperscalers making custom silicon. And the other like very interesting area here that I didn't talk about that much in the piece, I talked about a little bit, but.  There's like this, I would call like the silicon curtain, right? If you look at like for a long time, the anticipation of people who were bearish on NVIDIA was that the custom ASIC would come out of China, who would immediately kind of commoditize the space. And that hasn't happened yet. But paying attention to the bottlenecks of like China is investing a ton of money in trying to create its own AI accelerators. And they're not there yet. But investing along those bottlenecks is a great.  It's been a great trade. And it's interesting to look at when that became a great trade. If you look at like when the Chinese kind of semiconductor complex started really outperforming, it happened right around the rare earth export restrictions. And it's something where like the, really this outperformance in the Chinese AI semiconductor complex starts happening significantly after the July 15th export restrictions, like the rare earths. And then it goes really parabolic when some of the loopholes for the like foreign owned fabs in China get closed.  It's something where, you know, for a fact that China is spending all this money and China really wants to have its own independent AI accelerator and they're not there yet. But then, but if you look at what they need to do in order to get there, essentially they need to spend a bunch of money on memory. They need to spend a lot of money on trying to get to EUV. And I, the, if you look at, there's a company that's listed in the US ACMR, ACM research.  They are like, they're benefiting hugely from this and they're, and, but they're so cheap. And the interesting thing about this specific companies, they also have an A-share that trades in China. This company owns like the ADR on six of the A-shares and six of the A-shares is worth like five times as much as ACMR share price. So the watching that play out, like it's.  Very much the same as investing along is don't fight the Fed. Don't fight like the CCP when they say that they want to build a semiconductor industry, because whether or not they're successful, they're going to spend a bunch of money on it. I think positioning.  much as you can along like where custom where the bottlenecks for custom asics custom silicon is going to come from whether that's from google whether it's from video whether it's from meta or whether it's from china that's kind of like a theme that recurs throughout some of the trades that we've created that have to do with ai but just like we spoke about advanced packaging it's the same thing if you look at google the tpu stuff and then if you look at china there's there's a bunch of companies in china that have a shares and  There's also, and some of those companies also have upside to TPUs. And then some of those companies just have upside to China just building out this domestic thing. So ACMAR was one of our single stock techs. And so I'm looking at the China AI basket companies like Canbercon, Verisilicon, Zhongli, Inalight, Pyotech, Suzhou, TFC Optical, Communications.  James, why are you not long these companies? You've known about these companies. You've written about these companies for so long. They're up a gajillion percent. Why are they not into Citrindex? Because so we have metrics on who subscribes to Citrini Research, and most of them are people from the U.S. Buying A shares is very difficult unless they have the, you know, the Stock Connect thing. There are some A shares that you just mentioned, like.  like CamberCon, for example, or like the new IPO, more threads, which is like China's Nvidia competitor. I, if I can't own them in my own IPKR account, I don't put them in the, in the Citroen X. I do talk about them because, you know, we have like institutional subscribers that absolutely can go and buy those, but I try to try to make it so that people don't get upset. Cause they're like, ah, I like the stock five X, but I couldn't buy it. That makes sense. So you would be long these things, but you aren't because most.  non-super institutional investors in America can't invest in them. That makes sense. Yeah. But they can invest in ACMR, which again is a company that has an ADR and that all that ADR is a shell, like any other shell. And the shell basically owns, I think it's six shares for every ADR of this company in China that's listed as an A share. And if you look at the valuation described, you can't arbitrage it because you're probably not going to be able to go in short the A share.  it's pretty interesting that like you know the domestic like the a-share market which is you know people who are investing based off being in china and seeing what china's prioritizing trades at a five times higher valuation in the domestic market than it does over here like that gap will probably close so the us one is cheaper and it's five times cheaper wow yeah it's crazy  Okay, so I asked you about Google versus OpenAI, Google versus NVIDIA. You said, okay, it's not that simple. Both of them can win. What do you think about OpenAI? My biggest concern about the AI trade was that OpenAI would not be able to raise money. It does seem like they are raising a lot of money. I mean, I think if OpenAI can keep on raising money, the party continues. That's my view. What about you? Yeah, I'd agree with that.  Basically, it's like they're going to keep raising money until they and, you know, they're going to probably try to monetize as well. We'll probably see some commerce, but it's a difficult line for them to walk. Right. Because like we spoke about early in the podcast, there is this capability gap where AI is increasingly being able to do more things, but people aren't using it for those things because they're unaware that it can do that. So really for open AI, they're going to have to weigh the.  balance between on one hand we want as many people to realize what we're doing and like what ai can do right now and so that they can utilize it for their own purposes and on the other hand we're a company we should probably make some money so something where you know if if you break the trust of more people that are like utilizing ai for whatever the case may be right many of these new that whether it's images or video or doing excel work or whatever  And then if you do it too aggressively and it becomes something where like you put ads in there and, you know, I don't know, you're doing like, you know, analysis on a stock kind of keeps recommending that you buy the stock that you don't want to buy. And it's because that company paid OpenAI, you're going to lose trust for it. And that will hurt the closing of the capability gaps. I think that OpenAI realizes this, and that's probably why they've leaned more into the selling equity rather than like aggressively monetizing.  they really, they could be monetizing more. And every day that people use this and become dependent on it, it's like, I had like a pretty controversial tweet this year that was like comparing what AI is like, right? I mean, really, like if you're not using AI as much as you can, you really should be.  because a it's like in this golden age of like like similar to the internet before the internet was all like search engine optimization and adwords and and like delivering you commercial opportunities and at the same time it's also like it's pretty subsidized right like like you know yes you're paying for tokens but you can you can pay the subscription for open and you can become like a negative you know and you can become a loss and that won't last forever it's the same thing as like when uber was  way better than taking a taxi and cheaper. And eventually the company like gets the market share and they convert and they charge more for it because you're dependent on it. This is the time where you can derive the most value for the least cost by utilizing AI. So it'll be interesting to see. I don't know what the answer is for them, but I think so far what they've done is probably the right route. And yeah, I agree with you. If they can't raise money anymore, it might be over.  What do you think about Microsoft and why is no one buying Microsoft Copilot? Is that a concern? I think just it's idiosyncratic. It's like Microsoft has done not a great job with it. And it does tie into what we were just talking about. If you force this down people's throats, you can't force people to adopt technology. They have to do it on their own. They have to become aware of it on their own.  I think that Microsoft has taken the wrong route in trying to force AI adoption. And they did it way too quickly. And because the first impressions are everything, right? So like for Gemini from Google, like a lot of people's first time trying, not you, but for a lot of people, the first time that they tried Gemini was Gemini 3. And it's a really good model. And that makes it a lot easier for people to switch over.  when you're just like packaging co-pilot and constantly pushing updates. And the first time that people use it, they're like, this is garbage. By the time it gets good, they're not interested in trying it again because they've already tried it once. So I think that's like a big hurdle for Microsoft to overcome. And that probably was, you know, they were very aggressive about it and the market kind of disagreed with that strategy. So in terms of the various bear arguments I could throw at you.  One is that the customers are extremely concentrated. They're investing in themselves. The demand is somewhat inflated. The other is the depreciation angle where these companies are spending so much and the depreciation expenses are going to be so high, they might not earn that back. And I guess those would be concentrated in companies like Corweave, in companies like Nebius, but in particular, the biggest cap one would be Oracle, which...  Off balance sheet for going to a quarterly report has entered into lease agreements of a quarter trillion dollars. So the spend is enormous. Do you have concerns there? I actually don't know if you have any positions in Oracle or any of these companies on the Citrindex. I will look. But what about these kind of these stocks, these stocks that are the battleground stocks for AI right now, where it seems like the life or death of AI hinges on these trades or Oracle and.  uh core we would say i think that the there are some salient points there the kind of circular financing aspect is worrying and if you did get some kind of negative externality it'd be bad but just for the like sake of i feel like the bearish arguments on ai get so much play time that it might be worthwhile to  I'll just take this side, the super bullish side, just for the sake of making an interesting conversation. So the depreciation CapEx angle. So I guess the characterization of the bear argument is that hyperscalers are spending more than 50 billion a year on CapEx, and they're depreciating these chips over five to six years so that they can make earnings look good. But the bears are essentially saying,  these chips will be obsolete in 18 months when the next Blackwell generation arrives and then they're capitalizing assets that'll soon be worthless. Is that like an accurate characterization? That is exactly correct. That argument, a lot of people attributed to Michael Burry. I mean, I think it was Jim Chanos who made that argument far, far earlier. Burry is a sub stack now, which is, which is cool. Yeah. But the... I think yours is better. I subscribe to his. There are definitely two different things. I think the rebuttal from the bull side...  the life cycle of a chip kind of functions as a cascade for ai like like bears uh saying once a chip is no longer the fastest it's trash like these aren't iphones right the in the data center you get the sickest chip it's like the first two years  You're using it for training frontier models that are state-of-the-art. You're trying to make breakthroughs. You're trying to accomplish AGI with them because they're the coolest new thing and they increase your compute capacity so much. And then the new chip comes out and that chip moves to inference and running AI. Because inference is much less demanding on metrics that without being a huge nerd, you can do inference with an H100 right now.  Okay. You know, like that doesn't mean that those H100 chips that they bought are worthless. It's much less compute intensive, but inference doesn't make up the bulk of like actual customer usage. So that takes you from like those first two years where you're running these chips like as hot as you possibly can for, because you want to beat Google at the next generation of whatever AI can do. And then from years like three to five, you're just using it to actually deliver those things that you built with the chip in the beginning.  And I guess because we've been in this building phase, and this is part of the theory of AI has finally gotten good enough to be utilized for, and it's going to be increasingly utilized this year. Like that CapEx is deflationary. When you look at like high expenses in isolation, I get that theory, but I would argue there is a certain degree that CapEx is replacing future operating expenses. Just take like the simplest thing ever. There used to be this company called Task Us that like,  was dealing with AI moderation and got taken out. We wrote about it last year, but I remember it's such a bad job, dude. Could you imagine? Like you're just spending your entire day, like watching people get murdered on the internet. I like scroll on X for 30 minutes and then I'm like, wow, I noticed that I am much more angry than I was when I started doing this. If you think, okay, you spend a billion dollars on GPUs today as CapEx. And then over the next five years, you got to hire 5,000 less people to do that moderation.  that's like a very simple example the heavy depreciation charge is offset by the removal of those expenses so that can lead to like higher margins in the long term again i get like the ai is the thing right now that everyone's buying and it makes sense to be super skeptical of that whenever anyone this is like a an interesting argument about what is it going to take to train the next model but i would say  it also misses the point of if you are a it this is like a role reversal almost where most of the ultra bulls on ai are very like scaling law pilled  Right. It's like scaling laws are everything. By the way, if you haven't read the Isaac Asimov, a short story, the last question, I really highly recommend that you do so. He was maybe the first guy to ever explain the concept of a scaling law through that short story. It's 11 pages. I'm not telling you to go read a book, but the concept of the more compute we throw with this, the better AI we'll get. That is something where, okay, like.  On the bear side, you have to implicitly be a believer in scaling laws holding forever because you're saying, okay, the next generation of chips that we get, it's going to make AI so much better that it's going to be worthless to use the last generation of chips. Yeah, that's a bullish argument for NVIDIA. The Jim Chano's depreciation argument of open AI is...  You know, at Microsoft and Google's, their profitability is inflated because the new chips are going to be so much better that the proper depreciation schedule should be two or three years instead of five or six. That to me is a bull argument for NVIDIA. It's a bear argument for OpenAI, but it is a bull argument for AI progress. Yeah, and that is pretty much how these arguments fall. I think like people, there's very little nuance in this where it's like you do have to pick a side. Are you either going to be bearish on the hyperscalers or are you going to be bearish on NVIDIA?  because a lot of things that happen that are bearish for nvidia are pretty bullish for the hyperscalers because nvidia is making most of its money selling things to the hyperscalers at very high price and and vice versa i can get like the argument of why they they shouldn't necessarily go up together but  generalizing, like AI is this monolith of users and the, or like the CapEx spenders and the CapEx earners. I think there are some good arguments there, but it needs to be pretty nuanced. It can't just be, this is going to collapse because of X, Y, or Z. And we are seeing return on invested capital already, I think. Meta spent a ton of money on AI clusters and their ad algorithms became much better and revenue re-accelerated despite a tough advertising market. I think there's going to be dispersion for sure.  I don't necessarily buy into the depreciate. I'm not as good at accounting as Jim Chaynos. I'll just say that up front. And I don't want to disagree with him on accounting. But I do think that qualitatively speaking from like a higher level there, when you're just looking at the income statement, you're missing like how they're actually getting used. And if you get on the phone and you talk to guys that are actually doing this.  They're pretty concerned about the GPUs melting, which doesn't really conceptualize where it's, oh, yeah, there's got to be a lot of spare capacities. Yeah, maybe not yet, though. And then the customer concentration, that was the other bare argument that you had was what? Oh, yeah, customer concentration, OpenAI. I talked about that. I guess just with regards to NVIDIA, the view that AMD is going to beat them, the view that the custom silicon is going to beat them, basically other companies are going to stop paying the NVIDIA tax.  taxed by building their own ships with the Broadcom or with the MediaTek. And yeah, which would you say you're more bullish on, Broadcom or NVIDIA? Broadcom representing the Custom Asics, NVIDIA representing NVIDIA. And then I also know that you're very interested in MediaTek as well, which is a lesser known Broadcom. Between Broadcom and NVIDIA, I would pick MediaTek. Because you think that there's a tail situation of inference being on device, which we've spoken about on this podcast before.  They're also, they're trading at 20 times earnings and they're going to be designing the next generation of TPUs. But the everything keeps getting framed as I do think that there's use in looking at a parallel to the dot-com bubble, right? You can see what happens when there's a transfer informational technology. How does the market react to it? What happens in the real world versus the market?  I think trying to track it one for one, and I'm as guilty as anyone with this. I remember in the April drawdown, we made a bunch of charts that's, look, it's the Asian financial crisis, you know? And basically, like, but there are a lot of differences, too, that nobody really talks about. You know, like, one of the big differences is, like, you know, during the dot-com bubble, we laid a lot of fiber that we were just laying in case.  though it's like you know dark fiber uh we've spoken about that before that point originally was made to be by gavin baker and i think it's such a great point which is like the 95 of all the fiber that we laid in the late 90s early 2000s it was just basically build it and they will come and we're not doing that yet right we're like we're building it and they're there immediately the other thing is in the 2000s the concentration risk was mostly tied to like debt fueled startups with no revenue  So you think about Hats.com buying servers from Cisco. Today, the concentration risk is with the most profitable cash flow rich entities in human history with maybe the exception of the Dutch East Indies company. I've said exactly what you said, and it is technically true, but the end customer is OpenAI, which is not debt-fueled, profitless, but it is equity, VC-funded, profitless. Like Microsoft and Amazon and Google are spending so much.  is before like the real customer is open ai as well as in the other startups but the end we're trying to make that not the case right like they're trying to build their own like google right like they're trying to do their own thing and that's like i it just would be really and maybe this is like maybe like this is how it ends and where it would just be really surprising me if it basically ended when we have like open ai to the thing and then like you know and then there's like google kind of and then it's over  Like, I think before this is over, all of the hyperscalers are probably going to have their, like, they're going to be in competition with the foundational labs. They're going to also be making their own, like, they will build upon more startups in Silicon Valley right now are built on Quen that are built on than are built on OpenAI. So that's like a pretty bullish case for like inference demand and also maybe like open source and the Alibaba, right?  Yeah. And like, don't, I mean, kind of like, it's interesting to look at it. I think there's a lesson there to be learned about what China would do if it created custom silicon is like, they would flood the market with it and make it as cheap as possible to reduce the stranglehold of American companies. Because coin is open source. Yes. Is it bullish for Alibaba in the sense, wow, you made a model that's like, yes. Are they making money from it? Are they making money from the open source mod? No. You know, like, like maybe they're making money from using it themselves.  And also there, but if it's an open source model, you can run locally. There's not, it's, there's a reason why Linux isn't the most valuable company in the world. Then I guess there is like a sovereign angle of a lot of, a lot of what we don't see. Like we see the chat bot stuff. We see the video stuff. We, a lot of what we don't see in terms of AI use cases, because it's a national security secret is like what, what's being used for surveillance or for warfare. The, but they're probably.  well can the sovereign AI buyer could de-risk that customer concentration it's already happening and because there's a supply constraint right now it means that demand is fungible so if the if supply is still constrained for top tier chips and the backlogs a month months long if one hyperscaler like meta drops an order it doesn't just vanish into the ether it just goes to the next buyer in line  whether that's core weave or sovereign or tesla or xai or whatever like the it's it so there is there are reasonable arguments to be made on both sides but i do think that the way that and again there are a lot of things that could change that would make it that would make this equation totally different but the way that it stands right now i have a difficult time believing in  this is a trick of depreciation or this is just some customer concentration and it's going to go the way of the metaverse. And James, in an earlier interview, I asked you, will you be looking to short all these AI companies when there's a downturn, if and when this is a bubble and when the bubble collapses? And I think your response word for word was, if I'm good enough, what are you going to have to see for you to say, not only this is a bubble, but this is a bubble that's not inflating. This is a bubble that is in the process of deflating.  first i'd probably like to see that things need to get broadly silly first right not don't get me wrong there's some silly stuff going on i'm not like a firmable i don't fail to see that like you know i mean we had like this okay so in 2025 we had a crazy bubble in digital asset treasuries which were honestly  it's a real shame that soros was soros when he was soros rather than like being in his prime right now because he had to use the example of mortgage reeds which were doing pretty much the same thing as what digital asset treasuries were trading at a premium issuing equity and it's a shame he didn't have the digital asset treasury because what a better example of reflexivity and and that was totally a bubble and then quietly in the background with no systemic risk to anyone it unwound  and most digital asset treasuries trade at or slightly above or slightly below nap right now and and then yeah like you've had bubbles in like some of our drone names definitely got super bubbly trading like 1800 times earnings and you know so um but i think that it's it's kind of characteristic of a bubble that everything is it's like you need  broad kind of silliness. Everyone's super optimistic about everything. So I think that would be the first thing that would get me on guard about the bubble potentially being, I do think we're probably going to see that happen. I don't know the timeframe on that, but that would be the first thing to look for as far as AI demand, because that's, what's driving most of this. Like you would need some sort of air pocket in the order book for the inventory buildup.  I do think if we reconvene at this time next year, and it's extremely, and it's as difficult as it is right now, not that this doesn't exist, but it's as difficult as it is right now to find like concrete examples of companies increasing their margins or utilizing AI to, you know, then, yeah. But I think we just got to the point where AI is capable of doing more things than people could use it for.  I would put like a shot clock on that of 12 months. And if by the end of that 12 months, it doesn't result in actual adoption and we're not seeing this more broadly, then I would start to consider, okay, maybe this, like the longer it takes and the longer it takes to get to quote unquote HGI, the less likely it is that we're going to get there. And that inference on device trade, that is an ideal. We've talked about it before. Basically that.  rather than all of the computation being done in data centers, it's going to be done on people's phones so they don't have a lag and super quick. And the pretty elegant trade you suggested there is going long. A lot of the custom ASICs players that presumably would be building these chips that go on phones, Apple, Samsung, et cetera, and actually short the companies that are the net buyers of memory. So like Lenovo, Dell, and I guess Xbox, although you're not saying short Microsoft, but yeah, Nintendo that basically  are have to pay these very elevated memory costs yeah the i've thought for a while that like inference eventually makes its way on device and the biggest reason why that has been like wrong so far is because in order to do that like the next gen apple iphone is like the way that things stand right now would need twice as much ram and ram has gotten prohibitively expensive but  At the same time, and we go over this in the piece, we try to make it as simple as possible that there's, we like isolate five ways that they're trying to like algorithmically, or even from a hardware perspective, improve memory efficiency. If we get a breakthrough in any single one of those, inference will move to device because it makes sense. Every time that you ask ChatGPT a question, it goes to a server farm in.  i don't know wherever probably texas now it gets processed by a gpu that costs as much as a porsche and then it sends the answer back and that round trip takes like 800 milliseconds and that seems like nothing but in computer time that's a eternity especially when you think about the agentic ai acting as an assistant you want to be able to have a conversation like like i'm having with you  where the inference is being done while I'm speaking and then it's immediately delivered back to me. 800 milliseconds versus being on device at 200 where there's no tower involved. There's no data. The way that it is right now is great for a chat bot that's doing all these cool things. It's not that great for your agentic assistant that can like schedule things and buy things for you and all that stuff.  So if we want that future where AI is, there is a phone already in China where it basically watches your screen and interacts with the screen. It takes forever. It's not like a great solution, but it is the first like instance of seeing this. We have a video on the piece of it. But like, you know, booking your Ubers, you know, booking trips for you, doing like anticipating your needs rather than responding to reacting to them. Living in the cloud.  makes it more difficult. And that's not to say that AI in the cloud will continue to be a thing, but it's very much reminiscent of when we had this debate over on-premises cloud and what ended up happening was hybrid, right? It was on-premises. It was away from where you are. So we're going to have the same thing happen here, I think. And my thesis is AI has to move to the edge and a certain portion of it has to live on your phone.  But what I'm not as bullish on is I don't think AI necessarily needs to live on your laptop. I don't think AI needs to live on like your Xbox or your Nintendo Switch or your PC. Like that's perfectly fine to have cloud for that because you're doing more involved work.  It sets up for an interesting trade where because the bottleneck for running AI on your phone isn't the, it's the RAM. There's huge competition, but RAM goes into everything and it goes into your PC and it goes into your laptop and your Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch is a particularly egregious example because it's like the bill of materials cost is like 41% RAM.  And it already had a price increase of 300 to 450. And that'll go up again as RAM goes up. So I think the best way to put this trade on and be agnostic to whether this happens in the next three months, it's basically like you put the trade on, you're short the companies that are getting really hurt by increased RAM costs that don't have as much upside to inference being on device. You're long the companies like MediaTek and Qualcomm and the mobile inference enablers for like battery life and stuff like that.  then if RAM costs come down, yeah, your short leg is going to start going against you, but it's going to be really good for your long leg. And you can take that off. And the opposite, it's a brand keep going up. It's much worse for a company like Lenovo or Dell than it is for a company like Qualcomm or MediaTek or any of these more automatic factory. Another trade you mentioned is...  shorting a particular preferred security of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor's Bitcoin treasury company, STRD, shorting STRD and going long Bitcoin. Why this trade? It's a great, because there's a lot, I would say this, as far as trades go, this is one that is, has a lot more risk to it. There's a couple of ways that you can lose, but just from like a priority, it's like you've got this situation where  Michael Saylor has pulled off this massive feed of financial engineering and he's convinced a certain subset of people to take capped upside on an asset who's in that's entire value proposition is uncapped upside. Yeah. And then if you look at the preferreds that have been issued, there's one that's, it's like a bank prep, right? Where it's like, there's no penalty to just being like, actually, we're not paying dividends. Like non-cumulate, a lot of the preferred securities.  are cumulative. So if you don't pay a dividend, you have to end up paying its stacks on, whereas this particular one is non-cumulative. And even though it trades at a discount, you argue that it doesn't trade enough at a discount. Yeah. So it's still near par. And I just feel like if you are in an environment where Bitcoin's going down like that, if you look at what happened to MicroStrategy converts, which I paid a lot of attention to, flipped long in 2022.  And that was amazing because it had that embedded option. But the whole reason why there was still demand for that was because it had this embedded option, right? It was like, if we're solving, we're going to pay you back. And then also we're giving you an option that like coin bounces back, which nobody was expecting it to go from 15 to 120. You're going to make a crazy amount of money. With this, it's like once coin goes down, in the bull case, you're going to make 10% a year. And in the bear case, we're going to not pay you your dividend. And the security is probably going to go down 60%.  Because even when it's down there, let's say it does go down 60%, like you don't have the comfort of, oh, well, like this should trade back to par because there's the risk that they're not going to keep paying the dividend. And there's no, so that's, again, that is probably one of the traits where it's, it's much more of a watch list item and bringing it to people's attention that like, hey, there is this thing in the microstrategy capital stack that's crazy rather than just like, hey, put this on right now because.  You could have an environment where Bitcoin goes sideways and realizes like a 6% Gager and then you're slowly just bleeding on that. But if Bitcoin rips, maybe this goes down to an 8%. It's not going to go below treasuries. Right. Yeah. And I think, I mean, this is an example of like, it's just an interesting trade. And I feel like you come up with so many interesting ideas that are.  themes and then also within themes there's tons of ways to express the theme so that is something that people have never subscribed to your work may not be aware of it's just how diversified within the theme it is you will have 10 20 25 names so you know a one percent position within your entire portfolio is actually a high concentration you know for you and  As a result, I think ultimately, you know, I actually am kind of of the Charlie Munger school that it's good to be concentrated. So I prefer to be concentrated in my personal portfolio. But that doesn't mean that only people who have 100 plus positions are going to find value in your work. I actually like if you have a basket of 30 stuff, I like the theme. I like the analysis. I only, you know, I may only pull the trigger on like one or two stocks. And I think that.  Yeah, I just wanted to do that. That's like the, yeah, it's kind of like we're spending all day researching this stuff and we're creating like a very concise watch list. And yes, you can play things in a diversified way, but it's probably going to be better if you're an investor that's interested in this theme to have, like with our robotics thing, it's like with Teradyne.  That was like, I think 9% of our robotics basket, which yes, as a total function of the top level portfolio, since the robotics basket's only 20%, it seems low. And it is, but it's meant to, we spend four pages explaining why it's long. And then if you like it, you go for it. But at the same time, there's still other stuff to watch in the space. But yes, it would have been easy to just say, hey, we're super bullish on robotics. We wrote this 80 page primer on it. And then also we're going to write this single name long thesis on Teradyne. And you just buy Teradyne.  Okay, but Terodyne isn't going to trade necessarily on just robotics, right? They're also like part of the thesis was they've got this great business in semiconductor testing that's going to see this huge benefit. And then at the same time, you've got this kicker that will show up in numbers in 2026 of the Universal Robotics Amazon Robotic Arm, and that's going to be bigger than people think. But it would be almost like intellectually dishonest if our sole robotics like...  representation was just Teradyne. And you would say, oh, I guess robotics is up 150%. No, it's not. That's why we make like a broader, diverse, right best so that the value to the users, you can read our stuff on Teradyne and buy it and make it a concentrated position. I did too. Like I really liked the stock. That's why I spent 10 pages writing about it. But it's also the value of being able to go and look at a new factor and being like how, broadly speaking, how is the market pricing robotics relative to AI?  Like that's the value proposition there. Yes. And I will say this is definitely, you know, not to be expected or necessarily repeatable. But, you know, when we did that interview, Teradyne was at around $100. It's $198 now. So it doubled and I bought call options that were up over 300%. And then I rolled the strike up. And then those call options are now up over 100%.  And honestly, they could probably are up more. So yeah, that worked out for me. Yeah. So this robotics thing, you're also bullish robotics. I guess Teradyne is the fifth biggest position. What are these other companies in this robotics thing? This is tangent. It's again, like 26 trades. It's like kind of an opportunity to be like.  okay, what can we do that's additive to our existing themes? And we try to be as comprehensive in our coverage as possible. So when we wrote the robotics primer, we really dived deep on the supply chain and we came up with, here's the companies that are really interesting and various kind of like everything from autonomous driving to humanoid robots to robotic arms and stuff. But now we're starting to look at areas that have benefit from this advancement in robotics that's been supercharged by advancements in world models and BLAs and stuff like that.  And one interesting area that's pretty significantly underperformed that could start seeing margin improvement from robotics is the slop bowl. Because if you think about it, when you go to Sweetgreen or Cava or Chipotle, there's a person behind the counter and they are using a grid. Everything is set up in the same way. The guacamole is in the same place. The meat is in the same place.  It's very easy to use like a robotic arm from Fanuc to replace that process and increase your margins. And Sweetgreen, for example, like sold its robotics division, but they have an agreement with the company that they sold it to for a cost plus type thing. And they will see, these are like the easiest, one of the easiest places to implement robotics as it exists right now.  And so a couple, it's kind of, it's more of a speculative thing, but at the same time, it's if you look at the progress that is being made in robotics, I went to San Francisco recently. I met with a guy who is like right now using robotic arms to plug in ethernet cables and chips for data centers. And I saw a video of it. It works really well. It's right now it's tele-operated, but it's gathering all this data. Like robots are capable of doing things right now.  And we're going to see this year that they get implemented in more areas, even if it's not something that's right in front of you, even if it's happening behind the closed door, they will get used more in a consumer-facing role. James, two ideas I want to ask that actually are a 2026 trade. In other words, they are related to the year 2026. One, World Cup, and two is...  fiscal transfers in April. Just give us a very brief description of these trades as well as some of the names. So essentially one of the other areas that we try to focus on for the year ahead outlook is less so what we think is going to happen and much more what we know is going to happen and how do we trade it. So two things that we know are going to happen. The World Cup will be in North America and the tax refunds that people get in Q1 will be  much higher than previous years by depending on who's estimate you use anywhere from 30 to 50% higher. So both of those have pretty interesting ways to play them. I'll just isolate to with the world cup, for example, budget hotels in the U S have done piss poor. That is a function of like international travel to the U S got a little bit anemic after the after the, the tariff stuff and the geopolitical concerns. And then also it's been like, you got the K shaped economy and it hasn't been great for the.  people that are struggling or not traveling so budget hotels have done worse so something like chh choice hotels but when you have the world cup come in beggars can't be choosers and a lot of these hotels are already sold out or like that and like in vancouver the hotels are already sold out so those companies will see it'll be relatively isolated but in terms of base effects it's going to be huge and the this had the company the chs just continued to go down so that'll be an interesting trade isolated around that specific event  And then for tax refunds, again, it comes into like the K-shaped economy. If you think about the purchases, like larger purchases, not huge purchases, I'm not talking about like a house, maybe not even talking about a new car. But if you think about the purchases that people tend to defer because they're struggling a little bit with their income and liquidity, it's mostly consumer durables and then some in deferred medical or healthcare.  You have something like the, like a mattress, right? A mattress costs like three grand. If your average tax refund goes up to four grand, it's something where you've been wanting to buy a mattress. These companies have not done so hot, especially with the interest rate environment, the way it is. And then you get this influx of liquidity and these guys see a huge sales event. And then there is like the added optionality of if we learned anything in 2025, it is that.  Trump can do more things than you think he can. And maybe that'll change. Maybe he'll lose the house. He probably won't be as bold this year as he was last year. But there is like the incentives are there to do that tariff refund.  I think if you're already positioning for the tax refund, you kind of get the added optionality of maybe he actually does this to try to lock up the house for the midterms, which would flow through to the same exact kinds of things. These deferred consumer durables, these, and then also we have a bunch of other areas that we talk about on ways to play this, but that's one that kind of sticks out.  And all of these are just trade ideas, whether they're in your model portfolio. The Citrindex is a different story. So I'm looking at the Citrindex and your biggest three baskets are dynamic AI, fiscal, primacy, and then robotics, which respectively are up since inception, dynamic AI up.  229%, fiscal primary up 176%, and robotics up 24%. It was started in May of 2025. So I think a lot of the critiques of the newsletter business that we talked about earlier, oh, you throw out 200 ideas and some of them stick, and then you say, oh, pound the table, this worked well. The Citrindex is accountable. Obviously, it's actionable, but it really is seeing what worked and what didn't, and the numbers are what they are. Just what you want to mention, just a little bit, a quick bit about the Citrindex before we leave it there.  We built this platform. It's a, in my opinion, like a really useful tool. I use it when I'm making decisions. I think it's like a great centralized place to look at all of our themes, our macro traits, see it's really interesting. Once a month, I like go and I see, okay, what themes have out formed over the past month. And you always like find something interesting. The, that's like how we found like that the drone names started to inflect and.  We keep doing the work of exploring potential themes and breaking them into more specific areas. AI is broken down into top level and then also like interconnects, optical. So you can go there and you can just find maybe a trade that we talked about a year ago that's about to be a really awesome trade. And if you weren't paying attention to it, you wouldn't have noticed that. Yeah. And it gives a transparency that I don't think a lot of research has necessarily.  I completely agree.
