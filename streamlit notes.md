streamlit notes

1 the ui sucks. 
2 load the currnt opmp file as default and save the podcaset feeds and just fetch the new episodes. save in sqlite or parquet files for easy loading
3 the table killed me. as soon as I selected one espidoe it didnt work. test it out better. 

i like the idea of simple streamlit table. maybe save that to temp so we dont have to download it all again



I just wanna see the breadbrum or notifcation of each episide .. dont print it clogs the ui See belw




Exmaple Streamlit while loading.... horrible
